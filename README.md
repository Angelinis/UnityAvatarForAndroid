# UnityAvatarForAndroid

This APK is a prototype for an interactive User Interace using a rigged Avatar.

This APK was created through the Unity Game Engine, and the integration of a Simulator package.

On the other hand, the avatar was created through the integration of the Ready Player Me package.
